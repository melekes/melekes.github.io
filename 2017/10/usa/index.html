  <h1>USA: From New York to San Francisco</h1>
  <time datetime=2017-10-14T17:19:45&#43;0400 class="post-date">Sat, Oct 14, 2017</time>
  <p>I remember me and my friends sitting in a cafe and talking about the USA. How
amazing would it be to rent a car and drive from the East to the West coast?
From New York to San Francisco. From the city of bankers, where everything is
telling you that <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html">&ldquo;you should make more
money&rdquo;</a> to the technological capital of
the planet Earth, a city of programmers.</p>
<p>Was it by share luck or something else, but cards laid out just perfectly. We
got our visas just before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/28/russia-cuts-us-diplomatic-presence-retaliation-sanctions">USA reduced its diplomatic presence in
Russia</a>. We passed the US customs. So, there we were in the land of
opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="roads">Roads</h3>
<p>America is well known for its roads. And they are really good. Opposite lanes
are usually divided by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_strip">median
strip</a>, so little chance of head-on
collision. Surprisingly, we saw a highway police only once during a month-long
trip. There are rest stops and rest areas along all the highways - very
convenient!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the road from New York to Texas is kinda boring - plain fields
and trees. But eastern part of USA is just beatiful. By far my favorite piece
is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedona,_Arizona">Sedona</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cities">Cities</h3>
<p>See <a href="https://www.homeonrails.com/2017/09/usa-cities">a separate article</a>.</p>
<h3 id="food">Food</h3>
<p>Burgers, sugar, burgers, sugar, burgers with sugar, sugar with burgers. By the
end of our trip, I swear I can literally feel sugar with my tong (and I am not talking
about the sweet sensation). That's how much sugar there was. But apart from
that, USA is great. You can try cuisines from countries all over the world:
Mexican (guacamole - mmm), Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Italian and so on.</p>
<p>The selection of food in an average supermarket is superior. Imagine every
supermarket being as big as <a href="https://www.auchan.ru/en/auchan_russia">Ашан</a>.</p>

<h3 id="economic">Economic</h3>
<p>Obviously, they are doing good. But after spending one month in China, I was a
bit disappointed. A lot of &ldquo;CASH ONLY&rdquo; places, buses for long distance travels
(compare this to high-speed trains in China), not so many electric cars (again,
comparing to China). Overall, I now see why some people predict China
overthrowing the USA as a world leader in 20 - 50 years
(<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-us-vs-china-economy/">1</a>,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prisoners-Geography-Explain-Everything-About/dp/1501121472">2</a>).</p>
<h3 id="people">People</h3>
<p>A lot of people smiling. People say that it is a fake smile. I did not feel
that. In fact, for me, it was the opposite. I remember a few people smiling
when we saw each other with the sincere, kind and open smile. I think it is
because the quality of life is generally higher there and people are generally
more satisfied with their lives.</p>
<p>Also, strangers can talk to you and that's considered normal. Feels so weird at
first, but later you start doing the same.</p>

possible. Live long and prosper.</p>
