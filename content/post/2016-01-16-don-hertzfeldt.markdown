"Don Hertzfeldt (born August 1, 1976) is a two-time Academy Award nominated
animator, writer, and independent filmmaker. He is the creator of many animated
films, including It's Such a Beautiful Day, World of Tomorrow, The Meaning of
Life, and Rejected. His films have received over 250 awards and have been

Sundance Film Festival's Grand Jury Prize for Short Film twice.

Hertzfeldt's short films have been described as "**some of the most influential

Personally, I like his original style, the fact that he is not afraid to use
classical music and mix real and painted scenes.

This is a story about Bill, who has some troubles with his memory.

Author explores some existentialism and philosophy topics and uses a lot of
dark humor while showing us a life of the main character.
