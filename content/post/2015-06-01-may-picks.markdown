### Articles

* [Exploring message brokers](https://www.percona.com/blog/2014/05/05/exploring-message-brokers/).
  Comparison of well-known message brokers: RabbitMQ, Kafka, ActiveMQ, Kestrel.

* [WebSockets From Scratch](https://blog.pusher.com/websockets-from-scratch/).
  Very good article, which will give you a deep understanding of the WebSocket
  mechanics. Examples are written in Ruby.

* [Using logs to build a solid data infrastructure (or: why dual writes are a bad idea)](http://blog.confluent.io/2015/05/27/using-logs-to-build-a-solid-data-infrastructure-or-why-dual-writes-are-a-bad-idea/).
  I really like the idea of ubiquitous log for building complex
  highly-performant applications. If you don't know what it is (ubiquitous log)
  or currently into this topic, go read this article.

* [Please stop calling databases CP or AP](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/05/11/please-stop-calling-databases-cp-or-ap.html).
  "The CAP theorem is too simplistic and too widely misunderstood to be of much
  use for characterizing systems. Therefore I ask that we retire all references
  to the CAP theorem, stop talking about the CAP theorem, and put the poor
  thing to rest."

### Videos

* [Greg Young - The art of destroying software](https://vimeo.com/108441214).
  How could you write programs that, in the future, will be easily rewritable?
  Greg shares his point of view on this problem and a solution to it.

* [Edward Kmett - Stop Treading Water: Learning to Learn](https://yow.eventer.com/yow-2014-1222/stop-treading-water-learning-to-learn-by-edward-kmett-1750).
  Couple of valuable tips of how to learn things.

* [Cory House - Becoming an Outlier: Career Reboot for the Developer Mind](https://vimeo.com/97415346).
  Cory tells us about developer career, good vs bad habits, and all those
  things that could make a better programmer.

### Tools

* [z is the new j, yo](https://github.com/rupa/z).
  Replaced autojump with this. Works very good so far.
