This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most

book or even painting.

**The system works in all cases except those in which it does not.**

For a majority of cases the judicial system is
still working, but as we can see from the above
series, sometimes on "the ends"
([extremes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima)),
it fails.

In the first case, a millionaire cuts the human
body and gets away with it.

In the second case, a family man (poor, but kind
judging by the video) is sent to prison (for 18
years!) for the crime he did not commit.

Soon these things will be flying over our heads.

Like how the background soundtrack matches the picture. Great job!
