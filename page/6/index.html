  </h1>
  <time datetime="2017-10-14T17:19:45&#43;0400" class="post-date">Sat, Oct 14, 2017</time>
  I remember me and my friends sitting in a cafe and talking about the USA. How amazing would it be to rent a car and drive from the East to the West coast? From New York to San Francisco. From the city of bankers, where everything is telling you that &ldquo;you should make more money&rdquo; to the technological capital of the planet Earth, a city of programmers.
Was it by share luck or something else, but cards laid out just perfectly.

  Many of you probably know that for the last 10 months I've been working remotely at Tendermint. A few days ago a friend of mine asked me to give him some practical tips on how to find a remote job (being a software developer). I've told him that it's not so different from searching for a desk job. However, I did give him a few recommendations that I wanted to share with you guys.

  Disclaimer: my opinion on some cities can be biased and completely wrong since we rarely stayed more than 2 days in one city.
New York What I'll remember: the smell of urine and garbage in Manhattan, the New York subway, African Americans jumping over people (show).
When you imagine New York, you most often think of Manhattan and Central Park. You think of luxury apartments with a view of the park and limousines waiting for guests at the entrance.

  <time datetime="2017-07-30T11:48:01-0500" class="post-date">Sun, Jul 30, 2017</time>
  On the contrary to Indian movies, Brazilian movies are full of pain, struggle, and tears. These movies deeply reflect the history of their country, uncovering all the problems which exist even upon today. They were recommended to me by an architect from Brazil I've met in Lithuania.
Central Station (1998)   &ldquo;An emotive journey of a former school teacher, who writes letters for illiterate people, and a young boy, whose mother has just died, as they search for the father he never knew.
