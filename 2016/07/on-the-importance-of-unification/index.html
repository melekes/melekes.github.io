  <h1>On the importance of unification</h1>
  <time datetime=2016-07-05T16:24:36Z class="post-date">Tue, Jul 5, 2016</time>
  <p>Unification, for me, means having one way or instrument (not always the best)
to deal with a problem. And, in some cases, it is crucial.</p>

<h2 id="example-1">Example #1</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the design of the Go programming language. In one of my favorite
talks, &ldquo;Simplicity is Complicated&rdquo;, Rob Pike says: &ldquo;A lot of people have asked
for things like map and filter to be built into Go and we said no&rdquo;. He gave
this example while talking about the expense feature(s) may have, but I think
it also applies to the quote below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is a lot of features, you may look at the line of code, write it one
way. &ldquo;Uu, I could do something different.&rdquo; You might even spend half an hour
playing with a few lines of code&hellip; and it&rsquo;s kind of a waste of time to do
it, but worse, when you come back to the program later, you have to recreate
that thought process. Rob Pike</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Preferable to have just one way, or at least fewer, simpler ways. Rob Pike</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Highly recommend watching this video.</p>
<h2 id="example-2">Example #2</h2>
<p>At FunBox, the company I was working for, we had only one way to deploy the
code - <a href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano">Capistrano</a>.</p>
<p>We were using many languages (Ruby, Erlang, Clojure, Elixir). Each of those was
packaged differently (raw, release, .tar, release), but there was only one
deploy method. And it was great! <strong>You, as the programmer, do not think how to
deploy a project</strong>, you simply type <code>bundle exec cap production deploy</code>.</p>
<p>Capistrano itself may not be the best choice, but it&rsquo;s not so important,
comparing to what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<h2 id="example-3">Example #3</h2>
<p>Another example may be using <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/make">make</a> as a build
tool for all of your projects. Again, if you have many languages (e.g.
JavaScript on the frontend and Go on the backend), the cost of having 2
different ways to test/build/etc. may be too high. To ease the development, you
could create a Makefile and have a single target for testing (say, <code>make test</code>).</p>
