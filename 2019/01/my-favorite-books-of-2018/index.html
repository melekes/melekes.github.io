</figure>

<p>Another year, another goal - read 55 books in 2018. I failed to reach my goal
of reading 50 books in 2017 and &hellip; dropped the ball this time too. Why set
even more ambitious goal instead of lowering the expectations? Because lowering
feels like a step backwards and one should always strive to move forward. I am
still happy with the result - 49 books!</p>
<p>To be completely honest with you, I cheated a little bit by also adding a few
photo books. But I wanted to keep the history nevertheless. Note: it usually
takes about one or two hours to &ldquo;read&rdquo; one photo book.</p>
<p>Here are my top 5 favorites of 2018:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37976541-bad-blood">Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup by John Carreyrou</a>
The book was recommended to read by Bill Gates in his blog. If you&rsquo;re related
to IT, you&rsquo;ll most likely find yourself in the middle of the night not being
able to stop reading it :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29780253-born-a-crime">Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood by Trevor Noah</a>
These stories will make you laugh a lot, worry for Trevor and his mom, think
about apartheid, religion and education. Advice: listen to the audiobook read
by Trevor himself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23460459-sebasti-o-salgado">Sebastio Salgado: Genesis</a>
I am just starting to explore the field of professional photography, but this
book immediately captured my attention because I&rsquo;d watched his documentary
&ldquo;The Salt of the Earth (2014)&rdquo; before. In the book, Sebastio gathered shots
from different corners of the world including pictures of indigenous tribes
in Africa, wild life in the North Pole and many more things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life by Mark Manson</a>
Not like the other self-help books :) I&rsquo;ll probably reread it this year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14142.The_Art_of_Loving">The Art of Loving</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25491.Escape_from_Freedom">Escape from Freedom by Erich Fromm</a>
A deeper monologue on what it means to love somebody/something. His second
book (Escape from Freedom), provides great insights and thoughts on the &ldquo;the
illness of contemporary civilization as witnessed by its willingness to
submit to totalitarian rule&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
