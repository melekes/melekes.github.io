      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes us productive when working with code in the editor? Every day, there
is a new shining plugin, that allows us to do something useful by pressing only
2 keystrokes. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not against plugins. Hell, I have at
least 40 of them (&lt;a href=&#34;https://git.io/vrg64)&#34;&gt;https://git.io/vrg64)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, are all of them equally useful? I am certain that some tricks outperform
others in terms of productivity (&lt;strong&gt;20% results in 80% boost&lt;/strong&gt;). These could be
features, built into the editor. You just don&#39;t know about them. Here, I&#39;ve
tried to collect &lt;strong&gt;the most important ones&lt;/strong&gt;, which don&#39;t require you to read a
pile of docs and much time to learn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
