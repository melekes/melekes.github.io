      <description>&lt;p&gt;Migrations are probably one of the most killer features of ActiveRecord.
They allow you to design the architecture of the database along with the
growth of your project. If you change your data model (&lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/domainModel.html&#34;&gt;Domain Model&lt;/a&gt;),
you reflect that change in code and write a migration (or several migrations),
which will make the necessary actions on your database schema. This may be
creating a new table, deleting a column or adding an unique index.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
