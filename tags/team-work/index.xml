      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sharing knowledge in a team is one of the important factors of success of all
its members and the company as a whole. What it can be? Any sorts of things:
articles, videos, slides, thoughts on a particular tool - generally, any piece
of useful information that you would like to share with your colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s why it&#39;s important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each member of the team is &lt;strong&gt;growing&lt;/strong&gt; as a professional;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;communicate&lt;/strong&gt; with each other (this is especially important for
distributed teams);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The senior colleagues share their &lt;strong&gt;experience&lt;/strong&gt; with the younger ones (by
posting links to useful books or other materials and discussing certain
decisions they&#39;ve made in comments).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specially for you guys, I picked the 5 best tools to help you put your team
back on track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
